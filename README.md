## Questions

- Should this be one command that figures out what to do based on the situation or multiple commands?

## Road Map

- Add linting and all the other fun things
- Investigate using [@vercel/ncc](https://github.com/vercel/ncc) instead of checking in node_modules
- Cater for other libraries (maven, etc.)
- Upload artefacts
